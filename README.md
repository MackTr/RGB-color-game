# RGB-color-game

This game was produced with a code along in an online class I am currently following. In this game, On click events are the most interesting aspects, with the application of two different game modes. All in all, this game took some beginner to intermediate HTML skills, intermediate to advanced css skills, and advanced JS implementation. Feel free to give insights or point out issues.

Thank you,

Mackenzie Trenholm
